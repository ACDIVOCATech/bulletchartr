Description: This package attempts to provide a way to create 
    different types of bullet chart graphs to monitor "Indicators" 
    or "Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)" against a target. 
    This type of graph is a variation on a typical bar graph with 
    a thick line presenting an important point for that indicator 
    (benchmark, performance target, etc.) and other bars in the 
    background that can signify different levels of performance 
    (low-high, bad-good, etc.). This type of graph makes it very 
    easy to compare between related measures (e.g. present status 
    versus status at similar time in the past).
